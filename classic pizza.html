        <h1>Classic Pizza Recipe</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni or your favorite toppings</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>Olive oil for brushing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the hot stone. Otherwise, place the dough on a pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite toppings, such as sliced pepperoni or other ingredients of your choice.</li>
            <li>Season with dried oregano, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper flakes for extra flavor (adjust to your taste).</li>
            <li>Brush the exposed crust with a little olive oil to give it a golden color.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy your classic pizza!</li>
